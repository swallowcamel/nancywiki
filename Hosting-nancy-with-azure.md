#Hosting Nancy with Azure
##Overview
Honestly, this almost isn't worth writing, since there is very little to hosting Nancy on Azure.  Azure VMs now run full-trust IIS and so are capable of running just about anything IIS can locally.  However there are some Azure specific things you have to do to actually create an Azure project and deploy it to the cloud.  While these things are not Nancy specific, I will post the walkthrough here for the convenience of people who want to try it.
