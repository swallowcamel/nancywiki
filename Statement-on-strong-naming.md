Nancy is not currently signed with a strong name and it never will be.

The topic of strong naming in .NET OSS has been fully debated elsewhere so arguments for and against are not going to be rehashed here.

If you really require strong naming, Nancy is available with a very permissive licence so you are free to sign your own clone / fork.
