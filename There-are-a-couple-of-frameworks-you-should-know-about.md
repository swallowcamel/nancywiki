## We make extensive use of open-source

We rely on 3rd party open-source software while creating Nancy. All of these fall on the testing side of Nancy and since we try to use a TDD workflow, as much as possible, they are used a lot. In order to contribute to Nancy you're going to have to get acquainted with these since we are expecting (_shocking right!_) you to provide tests with your code. These tests will help us a ton with regression testing. Thanks for helping us out with it. Love you!
