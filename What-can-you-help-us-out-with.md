## Where there is a will, there is a way

You may be asking yourself “How could someone like me make a difference in a project such as Nancy?” Well, the answer is easy; if you have the time and will to help out, then we sure have places where it could be spent. Not all contributions to an open-source project have to be new features, there are many other places were help is needed.

* **Documentation**; both of the source code and contents on our [wiki](http://github.com/NancyFx/nancy/wiki)
* **Bug reports**; if you come across any quirks with how Nancy behaves, please log it in our [issue tracker](http://github.com/NancyFx/nancy/issues)
* **Bug fixes**; for the bugs that surfaces in our [issue tracker](http://github.com/NancyFx/nancy/issues)
* **Feature requests**; want something to work in Nancy, but don’t know how to make it happen yourself? Add it to the [issue tracker](http://github.com/NancyFx/nancy/issues) and we’ll get back to you
* **Test coverage**; we do try (honestly) to keep the test coverage really well, but there will always be room for improvements
* **Code quality**; the goal is to have a uniform coding style and use the same conventions all over the place. If you see we’ve missed a spot, then you have a perfect opportunity to become a contributor
* **Sample applications**; these are needed to show the world all things you can do with Nancy
* **Pretty much anything**; can you design a logo? blog about Nancy? there are a million ways to help an open-source project out - figure out which way is yours!
